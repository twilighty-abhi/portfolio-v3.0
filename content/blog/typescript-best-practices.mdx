TypeScript has become essential for building large-scale JavaScript applications. Here are the best practices I've learned from working with TypeScript in production environments.

## Strict Type Checking

Always enable strict mode in your TypeScript configuration. This catches potential issues early and enforces better coding practices:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```

## Type Definition Strategies

Create robust type definitions that grow with your application:

1. **Interface over Type Aliases**: Use interfaces for object shapes that might be extended
2. **Utility Types**: Leverage Pick, Omit, Partial for type transformations
3. **Generic Constraints**: Use generic constraints to create flexible yet safe APIs

## Organizing Types

Maintain a clear structure for your type definitions:
- Domain-specific types in their respective modules
- Shared types in a common types directory
- API response types generated from OpenAPI specs

## Advanced Patterns

Explore advanced TypeScript patterns like:
- Branded types for type safety
- Template literal types for string manipulation
- Conditional types for complex type logic

These practices will help you build more maintainable and reliable TypeScript applications.
