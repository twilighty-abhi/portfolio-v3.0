## âœ¨ The FOSS-ible things  

It was my first time being to India FOSS, and the first thing that came to my mind was, _I see a lot of familiar faces here_, both from Kerala and outside. Meeting new set of people was in my agenda this time, but ended up meeting less new people than i expected, but had the opportunity to connect with already known people. 

Well, I did wear a dhoti and shirt that day, Being the only dhoti wearer, many did notice me and I was Ajzal's favorite subject I guess ðŸ˜‚.

Listing out the people I met there would be really difficult since it was a bunch of them.
But one person that I want to highlight is @[alwin john](https://twitter.com/_alwin_john), who made the day with his [tweet](https://x.com/_alwin_john/status/1718197651798102224?s=20).

## ðŸšŒ The Journey

The journey started on 27th October. Initially I planned on going straight to the interesting place; But needed something more interesting to reach there. So bunked Friday's (27 October) class and went to watch **Interstellar in 4DX** â€” it was an amazing experience! 

After watching it, went straight to the interesting place **TinkerSpace, Kochi**.

What's more interesting than bringing a bunch of Keralites to India FOSS 3.0?

Yeah, TinkerHub had made the decision to pool the top _30 FOSS contributors_ and onboard a mission called **FOSS FORCE**. Then the members of TinkerHub along with the 30 contributors onboarded the bus ride from Kochi on October 27 at around 7:30PM. 

It really was a K factor to India FOSS 3.0 as said by Rushabh Mehta in [his blog](https://rushabh-mehta.medium.com/reflections-from-indiafoss-3-0-ad03f01ddecf), The ride was fun and messed up sleep ðŸ˜‚

### ðŸ‘‘ The Frappe Supremacy

Whilst being at NIMHANS for the two days of conference, I did spend most of the time in sponsor booth of Frappe. Them being in the front wasn't the factor that motivated me to be there; it was to figure out how things are working there, to find solutions to the issues I faced.

I really wanted an installation help from there, but I did figure out on my own later. Overall it was a great time spent knowing and reporting bugs directly to the team. Thanks for the long stickers too! ðŸŽ‰
