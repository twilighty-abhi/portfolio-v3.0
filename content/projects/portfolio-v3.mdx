# Portfolio V3.0

The third iteration of my personal portfolio website, built with modern web technologies and a focus on performance, accessibility, and content management.

## Features

### üé® Modern Design
- Clean, minimalist interface with careful attention to typography and spacing
- Responsive design that works beautifully on all devices
- Dark/light mode toggle with system preference detection
- Smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion

### üîç Global Search
- Instant search across all content types (blog posts, thoughts, projects, talks)
- Keyboard shortcuts (‚åòK / Ctrl+K) for quick access
- Fuzzy search powered by Fuse.js
- Search result highlighting and categorization

### üìù Content Management
- Markdown-based content system using MDX
- Git-based workflow for content updates
- Type-safe frontmatter validation
- Support for multiple content types: blog, thoughts, projects, talks, and now pages

### ‚ö° Performance
- Static site generation for optimal loading speeds
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Minimal JavaScript bundle size
- Perfect Lighthouse scores

### üåê SEO & Accessibility
- Comprehensive meta tags and Open Graph support
- Semantic HTML structure
- Screen reader friendly
- Keyboard navigation support

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The site follows Next.js 15 App Router conventions with a clean separation of concerns:

- `/src/app/` - Page components and routing
- `/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `/src/lib/` - Utility functions and business logic
- `/content/` - Markdown content files
- `/public/` - Static assets

### Content System
Each content type has its own directory structure and TypeScript interfaces:

```typescript
interface ContentItem {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  date: string;
  tags?: string[];
  published: boolean;
  content: string;
  // Type-specific fields...
}
```

### Search Implementation
The global search uses a combination of:
- Fuse.js for fuzzy string matching
- React hooks for state management
- Keyboard event handling for shortcuts
- Modal overlay with focus management

### Theme System
Dark mode implementation using next-themes:
- System preference detection
- Persistent user choice
- CSS custom properties for theme colors
- Smooth transitions between themes

## Development Process

### Planning
- User experience research and wireframing
- Component design system creation
- Content strategy and information architecture
- Performance budget definition

### Implementation
- TypeScript-first development approach
- Component-driven development
- Progressive enhancement mindset
- Accessibility-first design decisions

### Testing
- Manual testing across devices and browsers
- Lighthouse performance audits
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Content validation and error handling

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- **MDX for content**: Perfect balance of simplicity and flexibility
- **TypeScript everywhere**: Caught numerous errors during development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid prototyping and consistent design system
- **Next.js App Router**: Excellent developer experience and performance

### Challenges Overcome
- **Search UX**: Balancing comprehensive results with simple interface
- **Content organization**: Creating flexible schemas for different content types

## Impact

The new portfolio has significantly improved:
- **User engagement**: Lower bounce rate and higher time on site
- **Content discoverability**: Search functionality increases content consumption
- **Maintenance efficiency**: Markdown workflow streamlines content updates
- **Performance metrics**: 100% Lighthouse scores across all categories

This project demonstrates proficiency in modern web development practices, from planning and design to implementation and optimization. The clean codebase and comprehensive documentation make it an excellent reference for best practices in Next.js development.
