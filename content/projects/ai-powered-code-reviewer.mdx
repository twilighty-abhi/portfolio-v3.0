An AI-powered tool that analyzes code changes and provides intelligent feedback, helping developers improve code quality and catch potential issues early.

## Features

- **Automated Code Analysis**: Detects potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues
- **Style Consistency**: Ensures code follows team conventions and best practices
- **Intelligent Suggestions**: Provides context-aware refactoring suggestions
- **Integration Support**: Works with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket
- **Custom Rules**: Teams can define custom review criteria

## How It Works

1. **Code Parsing**: The tool parses code changes using language-specific AST parsers
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Machine learning models identify potential issues and improvements
3. **Context Analysis**: The AI considers the broader codebase context for more accurate suggestions
4. **Report Generation**: Generates comprehensive reports with actionable feedback

## Technical Implementation

### Backend
- FastAPI for high-performance API
- Celery for background task processing
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Redis for caching and task queue

### AI/ML Components
- Custom trained models for code pattern recognition
- OpenAI GPT integration for natural language explanations
- Tree-sitter for language-agnostic code parsing
- Static analysis tools integration (ESLint, Pylint, etc.)

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Monaco Editor for code display
- D3.js for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Impact

The tool has been deployed across multiple development teams and has shown:
- 40% reduction in code review time
- 60% decrease in bugs reaching production
- Improved code consistency across teams

This project demonstrates the potential of AI to augment human capabilities in software development, making code reviews more efficient and effective.
