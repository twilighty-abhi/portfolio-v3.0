This portfolio website showcases my work and thoughts on software development. Built with the latest web technologies, it demonstrates modern development practices and responsive design.

## Features

- **Dark/Light Mode**: Seamless theme switching with system preference detection
- **Content Management**: Markdown-based content with frontmatter support
- **Search Functionality**: Global search across all content types
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Performance Optimized**: Static generation with Next.js for fast loading

## Technical Implementation

The site uses Next.js App Router for optimal performance and developer experience. Content is managed through markdown files with gray-matter for frontmatter parsing. The search functionality is powered by Fuse.js for fuzzy searching.

## Design Philosophy

The design focuses on readability and accessibility, with careful attention to typography and spacing. The color palette is minimal yet effective, ensuring content remains the focus.
