A comprehensive task management application built for teams that need real-time collaboration and advanced project tracking capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can work on the same project simultaneously
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter tasks by status, assignee, priority, and due date
- **Time Tracking**: Built-in time tracking with detailed reporting
- **File Attachments**: Upload and manage files for each task
- **Custom Workflows**: Create custom workflows for different project types

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript for type-safe development
- Zustand for state management
- React Query for server state synchronization
- Framer Motion for smooth animations

### Backend
- Node.js with Express for the REST API
- Socket.io for real-time features
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Redis for caching and session management

### Infrastructure
- Docker for containerization
- AWS for cloud hosting
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the biggest challenges was implementing real-time conflict resolution when multiple users edit the same task. We solved this using operational transformation principles, ensuring that concurrent edits don't result in data loss.

Another challenge was optimizing performance with large datasets. We implemented virtual scrolling for task lists and intelligent caching strategies to maintain smooth user experience.
