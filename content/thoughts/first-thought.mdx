Code is poetry. It should flow naturally, tell a story, and be understandable by humans, not just machines. When we write code, we are crafting instructions that will be read and modified by future developers, including our future selves.

The best code is not just functional, but elegant. It communicates intent clearly, handles edge cases gracefully, and evolves with changing requirements. Like a well-written essay, good code has a clear structure, logical flow, and purpose.

I believe that writing maintainable code is one of the most important skills a developer can possess. It's not just about making it work today, but making it work for years to come.
