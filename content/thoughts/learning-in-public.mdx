Learning in public has transformed my career more than any other single practice. When you share what you're learning - the struggles, the breakthroughs, the failures - you create opportunities for connection and growth.

It's not about being an expert or having all the answers. It's about being genuine in your journey and helping others who might be a few steps behind you. Every question you ask, every problem you solve out loud, becomes a resource for someone else.

The feedback loop is incredible. When you learn in public, you get corrections, suggestions, and different perspectives that you would never have discovered on your own.
