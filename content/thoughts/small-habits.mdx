We often overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do in a year.

Small habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. A 1% improvement each day compounds to make you 37 times better over a year.

The key is to focus on:
- **Consistency over intensity** - Better to code for 30 minutes daily than 5 hours once a week
- **Systems over goals** - Build the process, let results follow
- **Identity over outcomes** - "I am someone who codes daily" vs "I want to be a developer"

What small habit will you start today?
