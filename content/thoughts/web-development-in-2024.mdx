The web development landscape continues to evolve at a breakneck pace. From the rise of edge computing to the maturation of Web Assembly, 2024 has been a fascinating year for developers.

One trend that particularly excites me is the convergence of server and client rendering strategies. Frameworks like Next.js and Remix are pushing the boundaries of what's possible, giving us fine-grained control over where and when our code runs.

The developer experience has also improved dramatically. Tools like Vite and esbuild have made builds lightning fast, while TypeScript has become the de facto standard for large applications.
