A presentation on the challenges and solutions for implementing TypeScript in large enterprise codebases, based on real-world experience migrating legacy JavaScript applications.

## Talk Content

### Migration Strategies
- Incremental migration approaches
- Dealing with legacy code
- Team adoption and training
- Tooling and CI/CD integration

### Common Pitfalls
- Over-engineering type definitions
- Performance implications of complex types
- Maintaining type safety across teams
- Balancing strictness with productivity

### Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in runtime errors
- Improved developer confidence
- Better code documentation through types
- Enhanced refactoring capabilities

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start Small**: Begin with new features rather than migrating everything at once
2. **Invest in Training**: Ensure the team understands TypeScript idioms
3. **Establish Conventions**: Create clear guidelines for type definitions
4. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on build times and IDE responsiveness

The presentation included live coding examples and real-world case studies from successful TypeScript migrations.
