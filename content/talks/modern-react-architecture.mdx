In this talk, I explored the evolution of React architecture from class components to hooks, and now to server components. We discussed practical patterns for building scalable React applications.

## Talk Overview

The presentation covered:
- The journey from class components to functional components
- How hooks revolutionized state management and side effects
- The introduction of server components and their benefits
- Practical patterns for mixing server and client components
- Performance considerations and optimization strategies

## Key Takeaways

1. **Component Composition**: Building applications through composition rather than inheritance
2. **Data Flow**: Establishing clear data flow patterns in complex applications
3. **Performance**: Understanding when to optimize and what tools to use
4. **Future-Proofing**: Writing code that adapts to React's evolution

## Audience Feedback

The talk was well-received with many questions about practical implementation details. Several attendees mentioned they gained a clearer understanding of when to use server vs client components.
